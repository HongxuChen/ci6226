- maybe original code is incomplete for a rest request ==> renderJSON
- no response should be my fault because postman can get response
- i need javascript if i want to use web page
  - must also 2 programs? NO
  - how to receive response?
- generate dynamic search result with javascript (cannot use scala directly?)
- get content of searchBox, process it, and pass it with GET
- use another stopword dictionary
- calculate the statistics
  - compute indexing time cost on server side
  - compute size of title attribute???
