\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}


In this study, we developed a search engine {\SS} aiming at the retrieval of publication records in DBLP.
It consists of a basic search engine and two applications.
In the basic search engine, users can search for the information of articles published in journals, magazines, conferences, and workshop proceedings with high precision and recall. 
We further give two IR applications. The first one is top-$N$ topic discovery, in which users can get the top-$N$ most popular research topics in each year from 2000 to 2015. It returns the top-$N$ topics within a tolerable time. The second application is to search for the top-$N$ publication venue similar to a given one. Experiments show that {\SS} can be applied into these scenarios effectively and efficiently.
