A search engine is an information retrieval system designed to help the users to retrieve stored information. In this study, we implement a search engine, {\SS}, aiming to retrieve publication information in DBLP.
{\SS} focuses on searching for articles published in journals, conferences, and workshop proceedings. The input queries can be authors, paper titles, publication venues, and$/$or their combinations. The returned results of each query are top-$N$ relevant records.
It is further applied to two applications: (1) searches for the top-$N$ popular research topics in a year, possibly constrained to other attribute preconditions such publication venues or authors; and (2) searches for the top-$N$ publication venues that are most similar with a given one.
